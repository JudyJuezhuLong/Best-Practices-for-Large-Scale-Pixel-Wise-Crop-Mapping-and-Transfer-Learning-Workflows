# üó∫Ô∏è Prediction Maps for Study Areas

This folder contains full-scene/entire study area prediction and reference maps for three study areas (Site A, Site B, and Site E) used in our manuscript. The prediction results are referenced in key manuscript figures and are summarized below.

## üìç Site A  
**üìå Reference: Figure 10b**  
- Prediction maps were generated by the Transformer model using only optical bands.
- Two training sample sizes were compared: 10,000 vs. 400,000 trusted samples.
- Although classification accuracy gains plateaued, increasing sample size **substantially improved spatial quality**, especially along field boundaries.

- `SiteA_prediction_map_supervised_learning_SiteA2023_Transformer_model_400000_trusted_samples_compress.tif`
- `SiteA_CDL_reference_2023_downloaded_from_ArcGIS_Pro_compress.tif`

## üìç Site B  
**üìå Reference: Figure 14**  
- This set includes maps generated using:
  - **Direct transfer** (Transformer model)
  - **DANN-based** transfer learning
  - **Fully supervised learning (Transformer model)**
- Under conditions of low domain shift, **both direct transfer and DANN** models achieved high-accuracy crop mapping (**>90% OA**) without using any labeled samples from the target site.

**Files:**
- `SiteB_prediction_map_target_SiteB2023_source_SiteA2023_direct_transfer_compress.tif`
- `SiteB_prediction_map_target_SiteB2023_source_SiteA2023_DANN_compress.tif` The yellow frame was caused by the internal buffer when downloading the satellite images (all nans in that frame), it is not an error, please ignore.

## üìç Site E  
**üìå Reference: Figure 17**  
- Maps were generated using:
  - **Direct transfer** 
  - **Fine-tuning R3**-based transfer learning
  - **Fully supervised learning (RF model)**
- The **RF model significantly underestimates cropland** and produces fragmented patterns.
- The **fine-tuned R3 model generalizes better**, particularly over larger field parcels.
- The reference map is provided as a resized `.jpg`, sourced from the BioSense Institute. Full-resolution access may require individual request.
